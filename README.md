# Basketball-Scoreboard
A dynamic, interactive basketball scoreboard built from the ground up. This project was developed on my coding journey as part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Path.

## 📖 Project Overview
While this was a guided project from the **Scrimba Frontend Developer Path**, I challenged myself to write the code **from scratch** using only a reference design. 

This project was a major turning point in my learning—moving past basic HTML/CSS and into the logic-driven world of JavaScript. It involved a lot of trial and error, specifically with getting arithmetic operations to sync correctly with the UI, but the result is a fully functional scoring system.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-time Scoring:** Dual-panel system for "Home" and "Guest" teams.
* **Point Increments:** Integrated buttons for +1, +2, and +3 points to simulate real-world basketball rules.
* **Interactive UI:** A sleek, digital-inspired aesthetic with hover effects and consistent branding.
* **Dynamic DOM Updates:** Efficient use of `document.getElementById` and `textContent` to update scores instantly without refreshing the page.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structured semantic containers for the scoreboard interface.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling using Google Fonts to achieve a "stadium scoreboard" look.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Core logic for handling click events and performing arithmetic operations.

## 📂 File Structure
- `index.html` - The semantic layout for the displays and scoring buttons.
- `styles.css` - Custom styling focusing on the dark-mode aesthetic and layout centering.
- `index.js` - The JavaScript logic that powers the scoring and interaction.
