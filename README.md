# 🏀 Basketball Scoreboard: Project Scrimba

A dynamic, interactive basketball scoreboard built from the ground up. This project was developed as a milestone during **Day 3** of my coding journey, focusing on the fundamentals of JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

## 📖 Project Overview
While this was a guided project from the **Scrimba Frontend Developer Path**, I challenged myself to build it **from scratch**. 

This project was my first real dive into JavaScript logic. I moved beyond simple styling and learned how to make a webpage "think"—handling user clicks, performing arithmetic, and updating the display in real-time. I even integrated a custom digital timer font to give it that authentic stadium feel.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Custom Digital Aesthetic:** Uses the `Cursed Timer` font and CSS text-shadows to recreate a glowing LED scoreboard.
* **Real-time Scoring:** Dual-panel system for "Home" and "Guest" teams with independent logic.
* **Point Increments:** Integrated buttons for +1, +2, and +3 points to simulate real-world basketball rules.
* **New Game Function:** A reset button that clears both scores and internal variables back to zero instantly.
* **Vite Powered:** Built using modern tooling for a fast and optimized development experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic layout for the scoring interface.
* **CSS3:** Advanced styling including `@font-face` integration, Flexbox for alignment, and glow effects.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Core logic for state management and DOM updates.
* **Vite:** Next-generation frontend tooling for the build process.
